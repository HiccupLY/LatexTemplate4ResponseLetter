# LaTeX Response Letter Template
Latex template to quickly write response letters to review comments. Based on @mschroen's [review_response_letter](https://github.com/mschroen/review_response_letter). 
## Features

- Well-structured layout for reviewer comments and your responses
- Automatic numbering of reviewers and comments
- Color-coded highlighting for added and deleted text
- Easy-to-use macros for organizing the document
- Support for citations and references
- Compatible with standard LaTeX distributions

## Files

- **ar2rc.cls**: The main class file defining the document format and styles
- **commands.sty**: Package that defines useful commands for the response letter
- **reply.tex**: The main file where you write your responses
- **mybibfile.bib**: BibTeX file containing your references

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Edit the `reply.tex` file with your own content
3. Compile using a standard LaTeX workflow (pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex → pdflatex)

## Usage

### Setup

First, customize the document header in `reply.tex`:

```latex
\title{Your Paper Title}
\author{Your Name}
\journal{Journal Name}
\lognum{Manuscript ID Number}
```

### Adding Reviewers and Comments

The document structure follows this pattern:

1. Start a new reviewer section
2. Add reviewer comments
3. Add your responses

Example:

```latex
\reviewersection  % Creates a new reviewer section (numbered automatically)

\begin{comment}
    Reviewer's comment goes here...
\end{comment}

\begin{response}
    Your response to the comment goes here...
\end{response}
```

### Highlighting Text Changes

To show added and deleted text:

```latex
\begin{quote}
    \textupdate{This text was added in the revision.}
    \textdel{This text was removed in the revision.}
    
    % For inline changes you can also use the latexdiff-style commands:
    The cat in the box is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dead}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alive}\DIFaddend.
</quote>
```

### Adding Citations

The template uses standard BibTeX citation:

```latex
This is our response with a reference \cite{BADUE2021113816}.
```

Make sure the citation key matches an entry in your BibTeX file (mybibfile.bib).
